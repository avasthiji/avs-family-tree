# Debug Steps for Missing Lines

## 🔍 Step 1: Check Browser Console

1. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:3002/family-tree
2. **Open Developer Tools**: 
   - Mac: `Cmd + Option + I`
   - Windows: `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   🌳 Family Tree Debug:
   📊 Nodes created: X
   🔗 Edges created: Y
   📋 Edges: [...]
   ```

## 📊 What to Check:

### If you see "Edges created: 0"
- ❌ **Problem:** Edges aren't being created
- ✅ **Solution:** The relationship data might not be loading

### If you see "Edges created: 20+" but no lines visible
- ❌ **Problem:** Edges are created but not rendering
- ✅ **Solution:** React Flow rendering issue

### If you don't see ANY logs
- ❌ **Problem:** Component not rendering
- ✅ **Solution:** Page refresh needed

## 🔧 Step 2: Take Screenshot of Console

Please share a screenshot of the browser console showing:
- The debug logs
- Any error messages (in red)
- The "Edges created" count

## 🎯 Step 3: Try These:

1. **Hard Refresh:**
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

2. **Clear Cache:**
   - Open DevTools
   - Right-click refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

3. **Check Network:**
   - Go to Network tab in DevTools
   - Look for `/api/relationships` call
   - Check if it returns data

## 📸 What I Need:

Please share:
1. Screenshot of the console with debug logs
2. Screenshot of the Network tab showing relationships API response
3. Any error messages you see

This will help me pinpoint exactly where the issue is!
