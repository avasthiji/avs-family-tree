## 🔧 Technical Details

### Built With
- **React Flow** - Interactive node-based diagrams
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling and responsiveness
- **Shadcn/UI** - UI components

### Components

#### FamilyTreeView Component
**Location:** `/src/components/FamilyTreeView.tsx`

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  relationships: RelationshipData[];
  currentUserId: string;
  currentUserName: string;
}
```

**Features:**
- Custom node rendering
- Automatic layout calculation
- Generation-based positioning
- Interactive controls
- Responsive design

#### FamilyMemberNode
Custom node component that renders each family member with:
- Avatar with fallback
- Name and details
- Badges for status
- Hover effects
- Shadow and borders

### Layout Algorithm

The tree uses an intelligent layout system:

1. **Current User** - Centered position (400, 50)
2. **Grandparents** - Top level (-150 Y)
3. **Parents** - Above user (50 Y)
4. **Siblings/Spouse** - Same level (220 Y)
5. **Children** - Below user (400 Y)

X-positioning spreads nodes horizontally based on generation count:
```
X = 150 + (nodeIndex * 250)
```
