⚠️  YOUR LOGO FILE IS MISSING! ⚠️

To see your beautiful AVS logo in the application:

1. Save your circular AVS logo image (the one with red border, 
   colorful people figures, and Tamil text) as a PNG or JPG file

2. Name it exactly: avs-logo.png

3. Place it in THIS folder (where this text file is located)

4. Restart your server: npm run dev

5. Refresh your browser

The file must be named EXACTLY: avs-logo.png
(all lowercase, no spaces)

Current location: /Users/abhisheksaraswst/Desktop/avs family/avs-family-tree/public/
